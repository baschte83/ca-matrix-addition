# Matrizes

### Assignment, class and language
This is the solution to the assignment **Matrizes** of class **computer architecture,** written in ARM Assembly with my team member [Ehsan Moslehi](https://github.com/eca852).

### Requirements
The main goal of this assignment was to measure and optimize system performance (with loop unrolling by the factors two, four and eight) for a specific application and to experiment with several compiler optimization levels and profiling tools. Main task was to measure the cycle count, the instruction count and the performance equation. 

We had to implement a function called `matadd`in ARM Assembly that computes the sum **C** of two matrizes **A** and **B**, which are matrizes with integer values. We also had to strive for the lowest dynamic instruction count and CPI (it is possible that the whole program executes less than one billion dynamic instructions) and, of course, our output should be correct (we got a correct output from our professor for comparison).

It is hard to say what is exactly my part of the work because my team member and I worked most of the time together on one computer and corrected one another.
